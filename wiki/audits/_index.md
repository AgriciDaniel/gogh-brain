# Audits Hub

Audits holds the checks that decide whether stack output is ready to ship or needs another pass.

## Catalog

### gogh/taste-skill

- [[Brand fidelity audit]] - Brand fidelity audit verifies that a Taste Skill redesign preserved the existing accent color, type stack, and logo treatment unless the user approved an overhaul.
- [[Em-dash audit]] - Em-dash audit is the written Taste Skill check that visible output contains zero U+2014 or U+2013 glyphs.
- [[Hero discipline audit]] - Hero discipline audit verifies that the hero fits the first viewport, has concise copy, and keeps the CTA visible.
- [[Pre-Flight Check (Section 14)]] - Pre-Flight Check (Section 14) is the mandatory Taste Skill v2 final gate: every box must pass, while the popular 60-item count remains contested.
- [[Preservation audit]] - Preservation audit verifies that a Taste Skill redesign did not silently change URLs, navigation, forms, anchors, brand, or legal copy.
- [[Required Audits]] - Required Audits is the taste-skill-scoped list of written audits that run around Section 14 for greenfield and redesign work.
